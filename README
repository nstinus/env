Introduction

- zsh
- emacs
- git

Installation
------------

Personal shit shouldn't be in the shared repo. A good solution
to keep your personal infos and still be able to contribute/develop
to this shit is as follows:

You'll need two repos:

The 'dev' repo is in ~/dev/env and it pulls from github.
  cd ~/dev
  git clone git://github.com/nstinus/env.git

The 'prod' repo is in ~/env and it pulls from the dev repo.
  cd
  git clone ~/dev/env

In the prod repo, create a new branch origin/master
  git checkout -b my_stuff origin/master
Commit the personal modif in there. And keep the repo on this
branch.

Then, you need the install the files. You can do that by for
example, linking ~/.somefile to the one in the prod repo.
  ln -s ~/env/somefile ~/.somefile

When you need to alter the shit (in a way that could be shared).
Go in your dev repo, make the changes, pull/push/test/commit,
whatever. When you're ready, go in the dev repo and just pull from
master.
  git checkout master; git pull
Then merge that shit in your personal branch
  git checkout my_stuff; git merge master
If you need to add personal stuff. You can commit on that branch,
just never merge my_stuff to master.

Of course there are other ways to do it, but this one is rather
clean and safe at the expand of being a little complicated...
